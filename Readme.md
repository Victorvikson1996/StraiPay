- By Generationg a random card number with 10 digits

- The task solution is written in two js files using Luhn Algorithm to check the validity of a credit card

- Solution in theory using Luhn Algorithm

`we first convert the number to an array of digits. Then, we double every second digit, starting from the second-last digit. If doubling the digit results in a number greater than 9, we subtract 9 from it. Then, we add up all the digits, and if the sum is divisible by 10, the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm`
